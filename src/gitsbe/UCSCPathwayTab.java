 * The UCSC Pathway Tab Format is designed to be an extremely simple
 * representation of a pathway. Each line in the file either defines the type of an
 * entity, or an interaction between two entities. Entity definition lines are
 * distinguished from interaction lines by the number of fields on the line: entity
 * definitions have two tab-separated fields, whereas interaction lines have three 
 * tab-separated fields.
